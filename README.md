The search.py and searchAgents.py files contain AI search algorithims that are able to successfully play and solve any pacman map as well as any game.

Algorithms implemented: -Depth First search
                         
                         -Breadth First search
                         
                         -A* search with Heuristics
                         
                         -Greedy search
                         
                         -Uniform Cost search
                         
                         -Suboptimal search

The Pacman game is already created by UC Berkeley and can be found in pacman.py.
